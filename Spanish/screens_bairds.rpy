Beware the smiling face in the crowd. Stand clear of the stranger who offers too much bread. For what may they want of you in return?\nThese curious beings run the gamut from helpful to hurtful. They can bear good luck, or portend great misfortune.

Near in size to the pipistrelle bat, a pixie is but a mere miniature human-shaped being with dulcimer wings that emit shining light as they flutter feverishly.

De un tamaño similar al de un murciélago enano, no es más que un ser con forma humana de diminuto tamaño y con alas de dulcémele que emiten una luz brillante mientras revolotean febrilmente. Estas diminutas figuras femeninas revolotean, sobre todo en los cielos nocturnos, y nunca visten traje alguno. Aunque bailan sin ropa, les gusta robar trozos de tela, así que es mejor proteger la cinta suelta de tu trenza."

Even a young one barely strong enough to walk will follow a pixie near to the fae realm unless the mother keeps a close eye on her. Pixies may even lead a grown man or a trotting horse astray, should either catch the gaze of these impish and alluring sprites.\nPixies are feisty, fearless, and adore exploring new surroundings, able to dip in and out of hidden caves and rushing waters with delicate ease. If you spot a pixie in the darkness, aglow like a candle's flame, know that their presence will always bring blessings to the home of those who show them fondness."

Incluso los más pequeños, que apenas tienen fuerzas para andar, seguirán a un pixie hasta el reino de las hadas, a menos que la madre los vigile de cerca. Los Pixies pueden incluso llevar por el mal camino a un hombre adulto o a un caballo de trote, si alguno de los dos atrae la mirada de estos duendecillos traviesos y seductores.\nLos duendes son luchadores, intrépidos y adoran explorar nuevos entornos, capaces de entrar y salir de cuevas ocultas y aguas turbulentas con delicada facilidad. Si ves un duende en la oscuridad, resplandeciente como la llama de una vela, debes saber que su presencia siempre traerá bendiciones al hogar de quienes les demuestren su afecto."

Though sometimes after a whirlwind jaunt of tidying and washing, they will intentionally knock over a small bucket of water, or smash a petite porcelain carafe before fleeing, leaving their mark of minute destruction.\nLittle, mighty scamps though they may be, these venerable creatures are more honorable than they appear. For every playful deed they may commit, innumerable pleasant tasks are provided.

Sin embargo, algunas veces después de un torbellino de ordenar y lavar, ellos intencionalmente tumban un pequeño valde de agua, o rompen una garrafa de porcelana antes de huir, dejando sus marcas de destrucción diminuta.\nTan pequeños e intensos picaros que ellos pueden ser, estas criaturas venerables son mas honorables de lo que lucen a primera vista. Por cada acción juguetona que realizan, innumerables tareas placenteras son proporcionadas. Sea que necesites finalizar un lavado, que necesites alimentar tus cerdos o que tu calzado necesite una pulida… el pequeño Ùruisg puede oír tu deseo por la noche e ir apresurado hasta tu puerta.

Oft depicted as a holy spirit or deity, the Cernunnos has the strength of many men, but, unprovoked, may be gentle as a newborn lamb. This combination of patience and power gives him the natural ruling authority over his beastly kingdoms, of far away fae realms.\nThose stories told by one's grandfather, or great-great grandfather, holding noteworthy discourse with the Cernunnos, be wary of their tales. No written record exists of a meeting between the Cernunnos and mortal man, because the deity insists that no encounters be documented. His contracts are oral and binding. Any change of heart will result in a man's curse the likes of which could never be survived.\nCan the horned god still be found traipsing in the lush hills or in another world altogether? Most say yes. But seek not the Cernunnos. Should he want an engagement, he will find you himself."

At once indifferent and invasive, the Glaistig lives among us, charming you with a kind smile before luring you away to commit unspeakable acts. While known for her protective nature, it is one that comes at a cost, that of expected discreet and everlasting loyalty.\nOnce a mortal, she wronged the fae by testing their boundaries and going too far. Her punishment was that of immortality and isolation. Whilst the Glaistig lives covertly, she is always around.

Wulvers will benevolently feed the poor, leaving freshly caught meat and fish by their windows in the middle of the night from whence they hunt. The Wulver will silently watch over those who are ailing or mourning.\nWhilst legend states that the Wulver holds an immortal body, pay no heed. A Wulver is as mortal as you & me. So, should you come across one of these creatures shrouded in the black air, whilst they show no aggression if left undisturbed, Wulvers are very protective of those whom they watch over. If the Wulver detects any sign that their protected are in harm's way, they may become dominant."

As mischievous as she is trusting, the selkie may draw you in with her beguiling gaze and try to lure you into the depths of her watery home. You may never know if you have been enchanted or enslaved.\nBut just as swiftly, a daring soul can steal her away from her underwater lair. The Orkney know all too well the tale of Abhainn Muir who was able to abscond with the skin of a selkie maiden, preventing her from returning to the water, and keeping her as a wife. After she bore him several children, she found the hidden pelt, slipping back into her skin and the ocean.

    old "\nHark! It has come time to discuss the epic creature of the dark skies and chilling landscape, the nightmarish fever dream that haunts youth and adults alike... the dragon.\nFiery and huge, with a typical wingspan measured in rods, the dragon is so easy to picture, yet so hard to describe. Born of a single, mottled egg, this fearsome beast doubles in size within hours, reaching its adult height in mere days. Should ye stumble upon a dragon bairn, count yerself lucky when you both steal a glimpse of the rare spectacle and survive the encounter without the fierce mother dragon eating you whole."

    old "The garbled call can be heard from leagues off. Their sharp-tipped wings—covered in glittery scales—flap so hard tree limbs will snap. The fire from their roar will char a home to the ground in the blink of an eye. Fire-breathing dragons can be tamed by few; witches all. Ne'er follow a siren to the cave of a dragon lest ye are looking to be tormented.\nWhat good these dragons be? While the males are full of unquenchable rage and desire for destruction, it is well-known that the female of the species possess a cunning nature, one that is both alluring and also just as deadly. Beware her hypnotic gaze, those glowing red eyes of mystery and deceit. They will lure you with the taunt of pleasure, only to offer you a slow death filled with unimaginable pain. But whilst on the prowl nightly, these female dragons protect all, summoning vengeance only on those most deserving, providing shelter and rescue to those most in need.\nIn 1859, a young woman claimed to have found cracked dragon egg shells the size of human heads on the shores of Ach-na-Creige near castle ruins. Her story was never confirmed, but the shell fragments are on prominent display to this day at the Northern Shores Hightower Museum in Plockton. Curators claim the shells glow during specific moon cycles, and offer restorative properties to various skin conditions when handled deftly."

    old "\nHere we arrive at the edge of the forest, of the expansive fields, at the precipice of seeming normality. Perhaps your mother or grandmother, after baking off a fresh cake, or sipping her berry-hued cordial, warned you to stay clear of the bramble and its delicious berries. Perhaps you only thought her to be warning of the bushes' thick thorns, or the tendency to drop blood-red juice on your knickers as you steal a handful as a treat. "

    old "But nay, these are no ordinary greens. It is said that as far back as time is remembered, the thickest brambles have served as the boundary between our world and the domain of the Fair Folk. They protect the land, preventing passers through; and woe to anyone who tries. For these twisted vines know the antics they can cause, and are eager to snare unsuspecting intruders into unspeakable fates.\nI know this legend for a fact, after speaking with a man from Inverness, who wishes to retain his anonymity. He spun his yarn of how the brambles caught him and his mates as they were traipsing through the edge of town, out collecting bramble berries for their wives' holiday pies. He thought he'd gone mad when vines took hold of his wrist, tugging him deeper into the brush. His vessel was threaded with thorns, tendrils, and greenery until he could barely breathe. All the strapping mens' bodies slowly took the form of ewes—common Dunface, to be precise—trapped fast by their new, thick wool. When he awoke from the nightmare, he found himself alone in a field outside the village, surrounded by berries, and wearing nary a scrap of clothing.\nHeed my warning that the brambles are the most dastardly plant one can encounter. Keep your hands to yourselves, your children close, and your holiday pies free of forbidden fruit."

    old "\nRobbie Baird is world-renowned for dozens of novels, including {i}Guardian of Cheshire, Falling Down the Toad Hole,{/i} and {i}Bridges Burned Between Brothers & Sons,{/i} several unpublished novellas, and playwright of the acclaimed drama {i}Lord Over the Hollow Crown.{/i}\nBorn in Earra-Ghàidheal and raised by proud Jacobite parents, Baird's life took its defining turn as a young lad, after ingesting foraged spores while hiking through Coille Coire Chuilc. This serendipitous incident induced a hallucination that he never forgot. Within this memory, Baird changed his born gender, turning into a woman Kelpie, the shapeshifting water horse. By the time he awoke from the dream state, he was in shock to see himself back to his male self. This tale is further chronicled in his memoir, {i}From Body to Soul: The Transformation of My Eternal Vessel.{/i}\nForthwith following this experience, Baird set out into the Highlands and beyond to catalogue the rare flora of the Scottish landscape, compiling their uses and effects in his encyclopaedia, {i}The Scotman's comestible botanicals.{/i}"

    old "\nWhilst out discovering medicinal plants, he encountered what he knows to be a {i}maighdean uaine,{/i} a real Glaistig woman. When he commented on her cloven hooves creating a faint din on the wood floors of a pub in an undisclosed location, she scoffed at him, telling him he was a drunken fool. Believing his past delirium in becoming a Kelpie gave him the power to see fae-born among his surroundings, he cornered the woman late in the evening as she made her way back home. He shared his tale of phantasmagoria, and this time she took notice, even lifting her skirt briefly to reveal her hooven goat legs. Their shared bond continued in the form of letters over the years, though Baird has honoured his promise never to reveal her secret.\nThese escapades and more have inspired the tales and history compiled in {i}Baird's Unabridged Compendium of Faerie Lore: Rhymes, Myths & Legends of Scotch Tradition.{/i} Reading through this marvelous wonder will connect you to fae culture, kingdoms, and creatures as tightly as the bond that once existed between man and the faerie realm.\nThis chronicle is faithfully and humbly compiled, executed, and confirmed by Robert Columba Crimthann Baird on this third day of September in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five."
