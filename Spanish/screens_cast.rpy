    old "Born in 1895 to a farming family in Ach-na-Creige, Scotland, Malcolm Campbell has always held a serene demeanor and a deep heart. Even as a wee bairn, hardly ever did a cry spill from his lips. A strong student—motivated to learn all subjects—Campbell was encouraged by his teacher to attend college in Glasgow. But the world had other plans.\n\nIn the midst of the Great War, Campbell enlisted in the Royal Scots Greys, leaving home for the first time at the age of 19. His first steps out of his village led him into the darkest of times, the most desperate of experiences.\n\nAfter surviving the horrors of war, Campbell once again returned home. There, he cares for his Gran, and has fallen back into his role as farmer. Still friendly, dependable, honorable, and brave, Campbell has become more reserved towards locals, even as he is welcomed back home. His life moves forward with the goals of providing for his grandmother, ensuring the prosperity of his land, and living a life that gives him meaning and purpose.\n                                "

Growing up she did her best to keep the farm running, the house in shape, and her sisters out of trouble.  It wasn't easy, but it kindled the dream of living a normal, domestic life.\n\nWith their father now away at war Marion finds it more difficult to be the glue that holds her family together.  She feels like she has already lost Jessie and is worried she will lose Grace too.

    old "The middle MacLeod sister, Jessie, was never much one for rules.  She wanted to live fast and free.  Humdrum country life, and the rest of her family's embrace of it, chafed at her to no end.\n\nNow with most of the men off to war, Jessie seized the chance to finally flaunt her freedom like she always wanted.  She dressed like the flappers in Glasgow and listened to the Yanks' new jazz sounds.  But it wasn't enough, not so long as she stayed stuck in Ach-na-Creige.  Jessie had to move to the city.\n\nShe works at the local pub, whose patrons don't know quite what to make of the misfit.  But once she's scraped together enough schillings, what they think won't matter.  She is leaving and never looking back.  What's to stop her?\n                                "

She never really felt like part of a group, prefering to withdraw from social activities and spend time alone among nature.\n\nNow that the sisters are on their own, Grace has conceded to help Marion around the farm—at least, when it suits her. One might have better luck finding Grace riding in the vales, or taking a dip in her favorite swimming hole.  That is, of course, if she wants to be found.\n\nWhile Grace strives to keep to herself, she might soon find herself a new friend; one who will fulfill dreams she didn't even know she had.

After Malcolm purchases the mare at auction (at a discount no less), he discovers her grouchiness is a bit of a challenge. While her history is unknown to her new master, he finds ways to develop a strong rapport with his sassy sidekick.\n\nShe finds her new life in Ach-na-Creige a bit curious, and enjoys giving others a glimpse of her churlish nature by bucking, neighing and being disobedient. Thankfully, a good deal of her irascible attitude can be appeased with carrots and apples. She definitely responds more favorably to wildflowers than whips.\n\nHazel’s charm comes from her headstrong and rebellious behavior. After all, she’s not unlike other women of Ach-na-Creige: strong, stubborn, independent, and endearing.\n                                "

Everyone's favorite—and only—schoolteacher, she is at once strict and loving toward the young lads and lasses under her care. Meanwhile, Alana's eccentricities have given her an odd reputation among former students who've grown up. Some go so far as to claim she dabbles in witchcraft at home, while others chalk her unusual behavior up to the stress of teaching an unending flow of unruly youngsters.\n\nHaving endured more pain than she's willing to share, Alana keeps to herself, preferring the company of children to that of other adults in the village. Equal parts mysterious, generous, and domineering, she also possesses a whimsy about her, which only reveals itself when she is around her closest confidantes. Get in her good graces, and you'll have her heart. Wrong her, and you'll face indignation that would make even a grizzled auld Scotsman blush.\n\nAbove all, the children under her care are her greatest priority, and she'll do anything to protect them.

When she isn't cooking, cleaning, or waggling a ladle to make a point, she can be found strolling the fields, reading a good book, or, more likely, enjoying a dram of whisky by the fire.\n\nSince losing her husband, Eachann Campbell, Agnes reminisces about the good times shared, and the years spent with her son and daughter-in-law before the arrival of her cherished grandson, Malcolm.\n\nWhile Malcolm was away at war, Agnes watched the village shrink as men left and never returned. Fear and sadness left her all but faded, but reuniting with her grandson has rekindled her spirit. To lose him again would trouble her deeply.\n                                "
