    old "\nDuring the Great War, a 700km swathe of desolate, crater-marked landscape like this marked the four year-long stalemate between Allied and German trenches. This particular stretch near Avesnes was occupied by the Royal Scots Greys, a cavalry regiment whose soldiers more often found themselves dismounted at the front line than in the saddle.\n\nThe Scots Greys were engaged in fighting on the Western Front through the entirety of the war. They were subject to dangerous scouting missions, German offensives and Allied counteroffensives, gas attacks, and deadly Spanish flu. Those who made it through unscathed count themselves as lucky indeed.\n\n{image=ctc_anchored}"

    old "\nDespite being surrounded by despair and destruction, many soldiers' most familiar enemy was boredom. To break up the bleak daily routine, the lads in the trenches found ways to have a bit of fun now and again—usually in the form of gambling. Card and dice games were most common, but sometimes soldiers were more creative.\n\nComing from a horse-riding background, some in Malcolm Campbell's unit organized races. But with no horses on the front line and only a narrow trench for a track, they instead raced the rats regularly herded by the group's corgi mascot, Sergeant Stumpy. A few good bets won Campbell a new pair of cufflinks, a pinup of a model from Paris, and a half dozen stroopwafels mailed to a fellow soldier whose parents were living in the Netherlands. While Campbell did share the treats with his comrades, one entire cookie was reserved for Sergeant Stumpy.\n\n{image=ctc_anchored}"

    old "\nThe Royal Mail was a service vital for millions of British at home and abroad, but even this venerable institution wasn't spared changes brought on by the Great War. The Penny Post, introduced in 1840 along with the first mass-produced postage stamp, set the cost of all mail through the British Isles (and later the entire British Empire) at just one penny. This lasted for 78 years, until at last the price was begrudgingly raised by an additional halfpenny in the final year of the war. Advancements in technology also made possible the first regular air mail service from Paris to London in 1919. Perhaps Malcolm's letter to Gran was carried on one such flight!\n\n{image=ctc_anchored}"

    old "\nDespite the dangerous reefs surrounding it, this unassuming atoll has had its fair share of unusual visitors. Blundering Billy Kane, a rogue pirate who stumbled upon the island after searching for lost treasure, was drawn in by the mirage of glistening crystals on cockel shells, only to run his ship aground and have to later be rescued by his nemesis, Plundering Philip Pickens, and his band of thieves.\n\nThe island was later rediscovered by Ulrich Uittenbroek whilst mapping for the Dutch West India Company. He supposedly named the land {i}Sint Pantaleon,{/i} after its odd trouser-shaped landscape. This expedition became forgotten after Uittenbroek and his team of explorers were pillaged by Plundering Philip Pickens on their return voyage to Curaçao. All maps were burned, along with Uittenbroek's ship, the {i}Negenenzestig.{/i}\n\nPresently, we see this island paradise inhabited by a certain scarce cerulean-scaled siren from Scotland.\n\n{image=ctc_anchored}"

    old "\nUpon arriving in paradise, Grace immediately set to emulating the islander women about whom she'd read. Food? Shelter? Such things could wait; first, she needed a lei to {i}properly{/i} lounge on the beach. The delicate, colorful flowers lining the edge of the sand seemed like prime lei-making material—that is, until she tried them on. That day Grace learned that uilepheists aren't immune to allergenic plants, and that even scaly skin can get hives.\n\n{image=ctc_anchored}"
